Feature: Create articles
  As a publisher
  In order to add relevant content to my news service
  I would like to be able to create articles

  Background:
    When I visit the site
    When I click on "Create Article"

  Scenario: Successfully create an article [Happy Path]
    When I fill in "Title" with "Learning Rails 5"
    And I fill in "Content" with "Excited about learning a new framework"
    When I click on "Save articles" 
    Then I should be on index page
    And I should see "Article is successfully created."
    And I should see "Learning Rails 5"

  Scenario: Publisher doesn't enter a title for the article [Sad Path]
    When I fill in "Content" with "Excited about learning a new framework"
    When I click on "Save articles" 
    Then I should be on create article page
